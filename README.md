# QED2022
This is for my QED project in 2022.

In this project, the n-queens puzzle solutions and the corresponding 1x2 tiling arrangements
are observed and calculation of the number of domino tiling arrangements of solutions to
the n-queens puzzle are performed. Based on results presented for n ≤ 15, it is hypothesized
that as long as the necessary condition of having equal white and black squares left in a
given n-queen solution, the remaining chessboard will be tileable. This is not always true
for other mutilated chessboards, as the mutilations could split the board in disjoint groups.
In the example of n-queens, the queens, or mutilations, are spread out so far apart that the
entire board is connected. The number of black and white squares being equal seems to
sometimes occur when n ≡ 0, 1 mod 4. On the other hand, for n ≡ 2, 3 mod 4, none of the
placements of queens in the n-queens solutions satisfies this property of equivalence.
